#Polar coordinates of a circle
x = r * cos(theta)
y = r * sin(theta)

radians * 180 / pi = degrees
degrees * pi / 180 = radians

#Rotating points about the origin
#Positive rotation goes counter clockwise
x = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)
y = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)

# Vectors
<ax, ay> = b
<bx, by> = a

-Dot product
a dot b = |a||b|cos(theta)
This can be 180 at most as it's the smallest angle between them

# Scalar projection (the amount of vector A that is along the vector B)
# how much of A's components are in the direction of B (90* would be 0)

#Matrix Multiplication
rows "dot" the columns
(rows, cols) x (rows, cols)
Cols of first must equal rows of second
Resultant has rows of first and cols of second
[a  b] [x]                                  [ax + by]
[c  d] [y] --> (2,2) x (2,1) -- > (2,1) --> [cx + dy]
